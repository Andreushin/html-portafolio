            <h3>Project 1: Movie Ranking</h3>
            <p>In this project, I created a movie ranking page that showcases the top movies of 2025.
            It includes detailed descriptions and images of each movie, providing an engaging user
            experience. The page is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: Birthday Invitation</h3>
            <p>This project features a birthday invitation page that I designed to celebrate a special occasion.
            The page includes festive graphics, RSVP options, and event details to make it easy for guests
            to join the celebration. The design is colorful and fun, reflecting the joyous nature of a birthday party.</p>
